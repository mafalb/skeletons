## Ansible collection skeleton

Use it with ansible-galaxy when you use init.

You can find a similar role skeleton at
https://github.com/mafalb/ansible_role_skeleton.git


### Basic Usage

```shell
[ansible_collections] $ git clone https://github.com/mafalb/skeletons /tmp/skeletons
```

```shell
[ansible_collections] $ ansible-galaxy collection init --collection-skeleton /tmp/skeletons/ansible-collection-skeleton local.mycollection
```

## Ansible collection role skeleton

## Ansible standalone role skeleton

## CI

There is a related repository which is partly derived from this repository and is located at
https://github.com/mafalb/ansible-test-collections.git

At least one of these collections in that repo is periodically initialized from this skeleton by CI.

```shell
[ansible_collections] $ ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/mafalb/ansible-test-collections.git,dev -p collections
```
