# This is far too complicated for me to like it.
# For now I do a workflow_dispatch to another repo
#
# This is not suitable for pull requests because
# normal pull requests are running in the forkers context.
#
# So I made the parts that are shared reusable and
# I made 2 files. One for pull requests and one for all
# other uses (push, schedule)
